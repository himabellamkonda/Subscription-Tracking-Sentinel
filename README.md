🚀 SubTrack Sentinel
Personal Subscription Monitoring and Alert System
📖 Overview

SubTrack Sentinel is a full-stack web application designed to help users monitor, manage, and analyze their digital subscriptions efficiently.

With the rapid increase in subscription-based services such as OTT platforms, cloud storage, music streaming, and software tools, users often lose track of renewal dates and total monthly expenses.

This system provides a centralized dashboard that tracks subscriptions, monitors renewal timelines, and helps prevent unwanted auto-renewals and financial leakage.
