### 🚀 SubTrack Sentinel
Subscription Tracking Sentinel is a Personal Subscription Monitoring and Alert System developed to help users efficiently monitor, manage, and analyze their digital subscriptions in one centralized platform.

In today’s digital era, users subscribe to multiple services such as OTT platforms, cloud storage, music streaming, and productivity tools.
